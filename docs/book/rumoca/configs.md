# Read the complete run configurations

These are the versioned files that the configuration generator uses. Expand a vehicle to
see its firmware binary, memory layout, QEMU timing, FMU selection, and helper
commands together. `fastdyn-config` replaces tool and output locations for your
machine and materializes the legacy environment defaults as literal TOML.

These select the current repository models. The archived, validated missions
use the different bases generated in [the first mission](getting-started.md)
and [other models](running-models.md). The outputs below use a separate directory
so inspecting these configurations does not overwrite a working mission TOML.

## Plane template and landing gear

`FastDyn.Plane` uses `Vehicles.Templates.FixedWingPlant` directly. Its three
wheel contacts generate normal forces, tangential friction, and moments about
the CG. The template includes a tailwheel steering term. The wrapper converts
FLU plant signals to the FRD sensor interface expected by the firmware.

The 5.5 kg mass, 2.1 m span, inertia, and wheel locations below are explicit
tutorial assumptions. They retain the larger aircraft scale; the template's
defaults describe a much smaller aircraft. This updated plant still requires
FMI event support and subsequent flight validation and gain checks.
