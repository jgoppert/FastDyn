# ── Critical framework rules that must appear in every generated prompt ──────
# These prevent common LLM mistakes that are impossible to infer from trace data alone.
framework_rules = """
## Critical Framework Rules

### 1. Absolute Addressing
The emulation framework passes **absolute guest physical addresses** to the model's
read/write callbacks — NOT offsets relative to the peripheral base. For example, a
read to a register at offset 0x08 of a peripheral whose base address is 0x40022000
arrives as `addr = 0x40022008`.

**You MUST subtract the peripheral's base address** from `addr` before comparing
against register offsets. For example:
```c
uint64_t my_periph_read(void *opaque, hwaddr addr, unsigned size) {
    // Convert absolute address to register offset
    hwaddr offset = addr - MY_PERIPH_BASE;
    switch (offset) {
        case 0x00: /* first register  */ ...
        case 0x08: /* second register */ ...
    }
}
```
If a device covers multiple disjoint address ranges (e.g., peripheral A at
0x40020000–0x400203FF and peripheral B at 0x40020800–0x40020BFF), your model must
handle both absolute ranges by checking which range the incoming address falls into
and subtracting the appropriate base for that range.

The trace data shows these absolute addresses directly (e.g., `address = 0x40022008`).
Use them to infer each peripheral's base address and register layout.

### 2. Callback Function Signatures

#### 2a. MMIO read/write callbacks (`_read` / `_write`)
The framework passes the pointer returned by `_init` as the `opaque` argument to
every subsequent `_read` and `_write` call. Your `_init` **MUST return a pointer to
your state struct** so the framework can wire it up correctly:

```c
static MyPeriphState g_state;

void* myperiph_init(ConfigSection* model_info) {
    memset(&g_state, 0, sizeof(g_state));
    // ... initialization ...
    return &g_state;   // REQUIRED — framework stores this and passes it as opaque
}

uint64_t myperiph_read(void *opaque, hwaddr addr, unsigned size) {
    MyPeriphState *s = (MyPeriphState *)opaque;  // valid: framework set this from init
    hwaddr offset = addr - MY_BASE;
    // ...
}

void myperiph_write(void *opaque, hwaddr addr, uint64_t value, unsigned size) {
    MyPeriphState *s = (MyPeriphState *)opaque;
    hwaddr offset = addr - MY_BASE;
    // ...
}
```

#### 2b. Inter-peripheral / timer callbacks
Any function pointer registered with a framework API such as `api_signal_register`,
`api_dma_register_stream`, or `qemu_plugin_timer_new_ns` **MUST exactly match** the
expected signature, and those callbacks DO receive a valid `opaque` pointer (the one
you passed at registration time). Your callback functions **MUST** accept the `opaque`
parameter and cast it to access your state:

```c
// CORRECT — matches the expected void (*)(void *) signature:
static void my_callback(void *opaque) {
    MyPeriphState *s = (MyPeriphState *)opaque;  // valid: you registered &g_state
    // ...
}

// WRONG — empty parameter list, undefined behavior when caller passes an argument:
static void my_callback() { ... }
```

- **Never cast function pointers** to hide type mismatches. If the compiler warns
  about an incompatible function pointer, fix the function signature instead.
- This applies to ALL inter-peripheral / timer callbacks: timer callbacks, signal
  handlers, DMA request handlers, and any other API that accepts a function pointer
  and an opaque/data pointer.

### 3. Stateful Emulation over Trace Memorization
You must implement a dynamic, stateful model. The trace data is EVIDENCE for
reverse-engineering the register logic — it is NOT a lookup table to copy from.

- Never emit "record-and-replay" code that hardcodes return values from the
  trace (e.g., `if (addr == X && count == N) return Y;`). Such code only works
  for the exact execution that was recorded and breaks on any other run.
- DO maintain a state struct whose fields represent register values.
- DO update state based on firmware writes at runtime (e.g., set/clear bits via
  masking when the firmware writes to a control register).
- DO derive read return values from current state, not from trace constants.
- DO keep the logic minimal — only implement behavior the trace evidence supports.
  Do not invent complex state machines, timers, or hardware features beyond what
  the trace implies. However, you SHOULD use your knowledge of the peripheral's
  reference manual for **bit field semantics only**: which bits within a register
  are read-only vs read-write, what individual fields represent (e.g. status
  flags, line state), and reset values. The trace is AUTHORITATIVE for register
  offsets, addresses, and runtime values — never override trace-derived offsets
  with reference manual memory maps. The reference manual helps you interpret
  WHY a bit behaves a certain way (e.g. a bit is read-only because it reflects
  hardware line state and must not be echoed from software writes).

### 4. Initialization and ConfigSection
The `_init` function receives a `ConfigSection* model_info` pointer that contains
the peripheral's configuration from the platform description (base address, IRQ
numbers, bus connections, etc.). Use it when calling bus-init APIs like
`api_i2c_init_bus(model_info)` or `api_spi_init_bus(model_info)`. Do not
hardcode values that can be read from the configuration.

Instead of providing the full source code, provide your code changes using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to update the model/s file.
Rules for SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:
1. The code in the SEARCH section must exactly match the current file, character for character, including all whitespace and indentation.
2. Include enough lines in the SEARCH block to uniquely identify the location (usually 3-5 lines of context around the change).
3. Do not use abbreviations, placeholders, or comments like `// ... rest of function` in the SEARCH block.
4. Output multiple blocks if you need to make changes in different parts of the file.
5. Wrap each SEARCH/REPLACE block in a standard text markdown block (text ... ) so it can be easily parsed.
6. **NEVER leave the REPLACE section empty.** The parser requires at least one line of content between `=======` and `>>>>>>> REPLACE`. To delete a block of code entirely, replace it with a single comment line, for example `/* removed */`. Do NOT produce an empty REPLACE section — this will cause a parse error.

polling_interpretation_instructions = """
NOTE: Polling patterns indicate that the polled register has bits that hardware
auto-clears or auto-sets.

CRITICAL WARNING: Just because a Polling detection appears in the "emulated model"
list DOES NOT mean the emulation is handling it correctly! If the emulation gets
stuck in an INFINITE POLLING LOOP forever, the verifier will still detect the
polling pattern because it sees the infinite reads.
Therefore, if you see a Polling Loop on a register (e.g. Polling Loop on REG_B), you
MUST check the "Entropy Mismatch Details" for the polled register (e.g. REG_B).
If the polled register has LOW (0.00) entropy in emulation while having >0 entropy
in hardware, it means your model is HANGING in an infinite loop and you MUST
implement self-clearing/auto-transitioning bits in that register!
